# Discord Profile Picture Tracker
This is a simple bot that keeps a tally of every time a Discord user in a guild changes their profile picture.

Commands:
- `/leaderboard`  
Prints the top 10 members in the guild
- `/check <user>`  
Prints a particular user's pfp change count
- `/modify <user> <add/subtract/clear/set> <value>`  
A bot owner command used to arbitrarily user values (usually when a bug occurs)
